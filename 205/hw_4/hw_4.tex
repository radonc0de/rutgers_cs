\item \textbf{Show that for any $n \in N$, $\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.} \\
Base Case: $0^2 = \frac{0(0+1)(0+1)}{6} = 0$ \\
Proving $n \to n+1$: \\
Assume for $k=n$: $0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + .. + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$. \\
Then for $k=n+1$: $0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + .. + n^2 + (n+1)^2 = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6}$. \\
Since both contain $0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + .. + n^2$, this can be substituted for $\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$. \\
Therefore, $\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + (n+1)^2 = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6}$. \\
Expanding these results in: $\frac{2n^3 + 9n^2 + 13n + 6}{6} = \frac{2n^3 + 9n^2 + 13n + 6}{6}$. $\blacksquare$

\item \textbf{Show that for any $n \in N$ where $n \geq 1$, $\prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 + \frac{1}{k}) = n + 1$.} \\
Base Case: $1+\frac{1}{1} = 1 + 1 = 2$ \\ 
Proving $n \to n+1$: \\
Assume for $k=n$: $(1+1) * (1+\frac{1}{2}) * (1+\frac{1}{3}) * .. * (1+\frac{1}{n}) = (n+1)$. \\
Then for $k=n+1$: $(1+1) * (1+\frac{1}{2}) * (1+\frac{1}{3}) * .. * (1+\frac{1}{n}) * (1+\frac{1}{n+1})= (n+2)$ \\
Since both contain $(1+1) * (1+\frac{1}{2}) * (1+\frac{1}{3}) * .. * (1+\frac{1}{n})$, this can be substituted for $(n+1)$. \\
Therefore, $n+1 * (1+\frac{1}{n+1}) = (n+2)$. \\
Expanding the left side results in $(n+2)$ and $n+2 = n+2$. $\blacksquare$

\item Find and prove a closed-form formula for the sum of row $k$ of Pascal's triangle. \\
Formula: $2^k$. \\
Proof: Pascal's triangle is not only a fun mathematical diagram but also shows the coefficients for terms in binomial expansion. \\
$(a+b)^0 = 1$ \\
$(a+b)^1 = 1a + 1b$ \\
$(a+b)^2 = 1a^2 + 2ab + 1b^2$ \\
$(a+b)^k = 1a^k + ka^{(k-1)} b + .. + kab^{(k-1)} + 1b^k$ \\
Setting both $a$ and $b$ to 1 would allow us to calculate the sum at each level. However, replacing both with 1 also simplifies the expansion to $(a+b)^k = (2)^k$ which can then be used as the formula for the sum of a given row. \\

\item Find and prove a closed-form formula for the $n$th pentagonal number. \\
Reasoning: For each additional pentagonal number, part of the previous remains. The only new 'dots' added are those to make up 3 of the sides (the left, right, and bottom). So, given the previous pentagonal number, or the number corresponding to $n-1$, since the pentagonal number for $n$ will have sides of length $n$, the pentagonal number for $n-1$ needs to have 3n added to it, but since the two bottom corner have 'dots' that can be considered parts of two sides, $2$ can be subtracted. Therefore, we are left with $3n-2$ for each additional pentagonal number.
